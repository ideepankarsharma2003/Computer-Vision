FairMOT is a multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithm designed to detect and follow multiple objects, such as people or vehicles, in video sequences. It addresses the challenge of balancing two key tasks: object detection (identifying objects in each frame) and re-identification (matching objects across frames to maintain consistent identities).

**Key Features of FairMOT:**

1. **Unified Architecture:** Unlike traditional methods that handle detection and re-identification separately, FairMOT integrates both tasks into a single network. This unified approach enhances computational efficiency and allows for joint optimization, improving overall performance. 

2. **Homogeneous Branches:** FairMOT employs two parallel branches within its network:
   - **Detection Branch:** Predicts pixel-wise objectness scores to identify object centers and sizes.
   - **Re-Identification Branch:** Generates re-ID features for each pixel, characterizing the object centered at that pixel.
   This design ensures that both tasks are treated with equal importance, preventing the common issue where re-identification accuracy is compromised due to a bias towards detection. 

3. **Anchor-Free Detection:** Building on the CenterNet architecture, FairMOT utilizes an anchor-free approach, estimating object centers directly. This method reduces misalignment between detected boxes and object centers, leading to more accurate detections. 

4. **High-Resolution Feature Maps:** Operating on high-resolution feature maps with a stride of four, FairMOT maintains detailed spatial information. This contrasts with previous methods that use lower-resolution maps, resulting in better alignment of re-ID features to object centers and improved tracking accuracy. 

5. **Balanced Training:** By treating detection and re-identification tasks equally, FairMOT ensures that both are optimized concurrently. This balance prevents one task from overshadowing the other, leading to enhanced performance in both detection and tracking. 

**Mathematical Intuition:**

- **Joint Loss Function:** FairMOT employs a combined loss function that integrates both detection and re-identification losses. This joint optimization ensures that the network learns to perform both tasks effectively without compromising one for the other.

- **Feature Embedding Alignment:** By using high-resolution feature maps and an anchor-free approach, FairMOT aligns feature embeddings more precisely with object centers. This alignment enhances the discriminative power of re-ID features, facilitating more accurate matching across frames.

In summary, FairMOT's innovative design integrates detection and re-identification into a single, balanced framework. This approach addresses previous challenges in multi-object tracking, achieving high accuracy and efficiency in both detection and tracking tasks.
